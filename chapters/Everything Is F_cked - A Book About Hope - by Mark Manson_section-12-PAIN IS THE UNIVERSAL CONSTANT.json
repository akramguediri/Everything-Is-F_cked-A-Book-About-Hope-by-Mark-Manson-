{"book_name":"Everything Is F_cked - A Book About Hope - by Mark Manson","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":7,"chapter_title":"PAIN IS THE UNIVERSAL CONSTANT","summary":"In this chapter, Mark Manson explores the concept of pain as a constant in human life, which shapes our perceptions and expectations. He introduces the 'Blue Dot Effect,' a psychological phenomenon where our perceptions distort in response to trends, leading us to see threats where none exist. Manson argues that the pursuit of happiness is counterproductive, as it often leads to greater dissatisfaction rather than fulfillment. Instead of seeking to eliminate pain, he suggests that confronting and engaging with it is crucial for growth and maturity. Ultimately, pain serves as a necessary element for meaning and value in our lives.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"An abstract representation of emotions and pain, vibrant yet somber urban landscape with a skyline under a dramatic sunset, low-key lighting, color palette of #EDE4D9, #9B643D, #1D1D1D with dark accents, introspective mood, digital art, illustration, asymmetrical composition, texture resembling brush strokes, close-up view --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"contemplative and expressive","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#EDE4D9","#9B643D","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Nature of Pain","section_body":"Pain is an inevitable part of life that shapes our experiences.
